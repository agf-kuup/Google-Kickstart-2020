# About
My solutions from the rounds of [Google Kickstart 2020][1].

# A bit more
Recently I found a [very cool github user][2] that has one repository for each Google Codejam contest.

I want to do something like that with this repository, but with Google Kickstart.
If someone reads this repo and considers it could be improved to be better understood, please send me a message to agf0710@gmail.com .

If I achieve to solve all of them, I will start adding the tables to describe difficulty and what topics are involved in each problem.
Even if there is an analysis in each problem, when one wants to try each problem by themselves, one need just a hint and maybe it's 
better to have the structures or algorithms used instead of the analysis.
